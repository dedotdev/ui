# @dedot/react-identicon

A React component for generating identicons based on a given address.

This package is heavily inspired by the [@polkadot/identicon](https://github.com/polkadot-js/ui/tree/master/packages/react-identicon) package, but with a few differences:

- Using dedot utilities instead of polkadot{.js} utilities
