# @dedot/react-identicon

A React component for generating identicons based on a given address.

This package is heavily inspired by the [@polkadot/identicon](https://github.com/polkadot-js/ui/tree/master/packages/react-identicon) package. A big thank to all the maintainers/contributors of this awesome library.
